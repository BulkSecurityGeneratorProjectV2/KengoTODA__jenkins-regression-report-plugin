Jenkins regression report plugin
================================
This plugin sends a mail if your test cases find regressions.

![built and tested on DEV@cloud](http://static-www.cloudbees.com/images/badges/BuiltOnDEV.png)


Scenario
--------
 * There a lot of failures in your build.
 * You have to find regression (new failure) but it's little difficult.
 * So picking up regression automatically is helpful you to enhance quality.
